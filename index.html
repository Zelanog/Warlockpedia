            made by
            Jasmine “Troacctid” Lawrence, I am merely a fan of her work, and wanted to organize and make a redesign of
            said content
            in a webpage, you can find the original Warlockopedia <a
                href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1xLnDuzhHsPCEz_eX0yTYIf7M5w6QnipN3lFSYmoPhbg/mobilebasic">Here</a>.

        <p class="introtxt">Hi! My name is Jasmine, and I'm here to talk about warlocks. (Specifically, warlocks in D&D
            3.5e—if you're a
            5e player, sorry, I'm sure there's another guide for that somewhere.)</p>
        <p class="introtxt">So. Here we are. Welcome to my Warlockopedia, a fully comprehensive handbook covering
            everything you need to
            know to play a warlock, whether you're a newer player looking for advice and sample builds, a more invested
            player looking for fresh ways to optimize, or a grizzled veteran looking for a quick reference tool. The
            comprehensive nature of this handbook means that even non-warlocks should find it useful, too, particularly
            the sections on items, feats, templates, and Use Magic Device.</p>

        <p id="subtxt" class="marg">What is a Warlock?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wwar">
        <p>Story-wise, according to Complete Arcane, a warlock comes about when a powerful extraplanar entity, usually a
            chaotic and/or evil one, decides to bestow arcane might upon a mortal, giving them all sorts of dark and
            edgy powers. Later material backed off of the “dark and edgy” aspect somewhat, but warlocks are still
            required to be Chaotic or Evil, although you do not lose any class features if your alignment changes.</p>
        <p>The warlock class uses a form of innate magic known as invocations. Unlike other arcane spellcasters,
            warlocks don't have spell slots. Instead, all of their invocations are usable at will. Once you learn one,
            you can use it as much as you want without limit. The signature invocation of the warlock is eldritch blast,
            which allows you to deal a modest amount of untyped damage with a successful ranged touch attack. Other
            invocations are divided into least, lesser, greater, and dark invocations. You unlock a new category every 5
            levels after 1st, and over the course of 20 levels, you end up getting 3 invocations from each category,
            plus detect magic and eldritch blast. Some invocations modify your eldritch blast, altering its properties
            to add additional bonuses and the like.</p>
        <p>Warlocks also have a natural knack for using magic items, gaining the ability to always take 10 on Use Magic
            Device checks at level 4 and the ability to bypass spell requirements for crafting magic items at level 12.
        </p>
        <p>Last and definitely least, warlocks have supernatural resilience, and gain small amounts of damage reduction,
            limited fast healing, and energy resistance, which helps a little bit to make up for the squishy d6 hit die
            they're stuck with, but not that much.</p>
        <p>Warlock base stats are like a slightly beefier sorcerer. You get a d6 hit die, medium base attack bonus, good
            Will saves, and 2 + Int skill points per level. It's a pretty weak chassis. In particular, warlocks tend to
            be skill-starved, but we'll get to that later.</p>
        <p>Less experienced players and DMs sometimes balk at the warlock's at-will abilities and overestimate the
            class's power. This is an overreaction. Yes, they have an at-will attack, but so does any schmoe with a
            weapon, and the warlock's doesn't deal a ton of damage. Yes, they have powerful utility abilities, but
            invocations are scarce and tend to be less individually powerful than the spells that traditional
            spellcasters unlock at the same level. On the whole, the class is actually pretty well-balanced against the
            rest of the game, and could even stand to be buffed a little bit. (For one thing, I'd definitely put them at
            4 skill points and a d8 hit die, like dragonfire adepts.) In the most recent iteration of the tier system,
            the warlock landed into Tier 3, alongside classes like bard, duskblade, healer, swordsage, warmage, and
            wilder.</p>

    <div class="introduction">

        <h3 class="titles">Playing a Warlock</h3>

        <div class="wwar">

            <p>The warlock play pattern has three pillars. The first is eldritch blast. This is the most visible and
                iconic
                feature of the warlock. You shoot lasers. Eldritch blast is a touch attack, so most enemies will have
                difficulty defending against it, and the damage is untyped, so energy resistance doesn't apply. Spell
                resistance can be an issue, but otherwise, you should have a pretty good hit rate. Your invocation
                options
                also include blast shape and eldritch essence invocations, which can modify your blasts, letting you
                attach
                rider effects or hit multiple targets or the like.</p>
            <p>Bear in mind that eldritch blast does not naturally do a whole lot of damage (unless you sink a lot of
                resources into improving it). You're not a striker. What it does do is give you a consistent source of
                damage, turn after turn, so that you'll almost always be able to contribute in combat at least a little.
                For
                the most part, the addition of blast shapes and eldritch essences won't improve your damage all that
                much—at
                least not to striker levels—but with some investment, it can turn you into a reasonably potent support
                blaster, tagging multiple enemies at a time with debuffs while also taking bites out of their hit
                points.
            </p>
            <p>(Side note: while eldritch blast is often thought of as a laser beam, it doesn't have to be. I've seen
                exploding flowers, eye beams, sword beams, rocket launchers, charged playing cards, Megaman-style arm
                cannons, cartoon hearts delivered by blowing a kiss, and least one walking Monty Python reference who
                summoned eldritch killer rabbits to run over and very briefly savage his enemies. Don't be afraid to
                give it
                your own flair. Warlock Concepts has some ideas to help inspire you.)</p>
            <p>The second pillar is invocations. You don't get very many of them, but the ones you do get should have a
                high
                impact. You can fly, teleport, turn invisible, mind-control people, command undead armies, or whatever,
                and
                you can do it all day long, without any concern for conserving magical resources. This tends to make
                warlocks very good at solving whatever specific problem they specced for. For example, if you choose
                voracious dispelling as one of your invocations, you're gonna be really, really good at making unwanted
                spell effects go away. If you choose flee the scene, you can teleport your way past walls and obstacles
                with
                utter impunity. If you choose call of the beast, then you can talk with the animals, walk with the
                animals,
                and even grunt and squeak and squawk with the animals. However, because of your limited number of
                choices,
                you often end up having a very small toolbox with just a few really high-quality tools.</p>
            <p>Invocations compete for space with eldritch blast upgrades. If you take a bunch of blast shapes and
                eldritch
                essences, you have less room for the powerful utility effects, and vice versa. Try and find a balance as
                best you can according to the needs of your party.</p>
            <p>This brings us to the third pillar: Use Magic Device. Thanks to their 4th level ability, warlocks are
                exceptionally good at making use of wands, scrolls, and other magic items that would normally be
                restricted
                by class. It's important not to overlook this aspect of the class, because it goes a long way towards
                patching up your biggest weakness: inflexibility. Remember how I said you have a small toolbox? UMD
                allows
                you to make it a lot bigger. By stocking up on wands and scrolls of useful spells, you can vastly expand
                your options and make yourself a greater asset to your party. The level 12 crafting ability falls under
                this
                pillar as well, although because it comes online so late and is limited by feat selection, it's not
                quite as
                core to the class.</p>
            <p>Oh, and you get some skills too, although not very many. Most warlocks should prioritize Concentration,
                Spellcraft, and Use Magic Device, but if you can find room, you might also have some social skills with
                Bluff, Intimidate, and/or Sense Motive, or some scholarly aptitude with Knowledge (arcana, planes,
                and/or
                religion).</p>
            <p>As a whole, warlock is a relatively simple class to play. You can always pew-pew with lasers, and you
                have
                some other powers that tend to be fairly straightforward. It's hard to screw up too badly, because
                there's a
                natural baseline level of competency inherent in the progression. (Even if all you're doing is hitting a
                single target with touch attacks for a few d6 of damage a turn, you're definitely underperforming, but
                at
                least you're not totally useless). The trickiest bit is that third pillar. Magic items can really
                elevate
                your game if you use them effectively, but managing your wealth can require some finesse.</p>

        <h3 class="titles">Melee Warlocks</h3>

        <div class="wwar">
            <p>Warlocks can also function as melee brawlers via one of several methods. The hideous blow invocation
                allows you to add your eldritch blast damage to a melee weapon attack. The eldritch glaive invocation
                from Dragon Magic allows you to make a full attack in melee with your eldritch blast as if it were a
                reach weapon. The Eldritch Claws feat from Dragon Magazine #358 allows you to use a free action to
                change your eldritch blast into a pair of claws, which can be used as primary natural attacks and deal
                damage equal to your eldritch blast damage plus your unarmed strike damage. And finally, the somewhat
                dubious Grappling Blast feat, also from Dragon #358, allows you to discharge an eldritch blast along
                with each successful grapple check you make to deal damage.

            </p>
            <p>If you invest in melee combat, you can achieve substantially higher single-target damage than your ranged
                counterparts, either by adding Strength and weapon bonuses with hideous blow, making multiple attacks
                with eldritch glaive, or a little of both with Eldritch Claws. I'll cover some of these styles in bits
                and pieces elsewhere in the guide. Shinken's Guide to Melee Warlocks offers a more focused look into the
                topic.
