            Jasmine “Troacctid” Lawrence, I am merely a fan of her work, and wanted to organize and make a redesign of
            said content
            in a webpage, you can find the original Warlockopedia <a

        <p class="introtxt">Hi! My name is Jasmine, and I'm here to talk about warlocks. (Specifically, warlocks in D&D
            3.5e—if you're a
            5e player, sorry, I'm sure there's another guide for that somewhere.)</p>
        <p class="introtxt">So. Here we are. Welcome to my Warlockopedia, a fully comprehensive handbook covering
            everything you need to
            know to play a warlock, whether you're a newer player looking for advice and sample builds, a more invested
            player looking for fresh ways to optimize, or a grizzled veteran looking for a quick reference tool. The
            comprehensive nature of this handbook means that even non-warlocks should find it useful, too, particularly
            the sections on items, feats, templates, and Use Magic Device.</p>

        <p id="subtxt" class="marg">What is a Warlock?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wwar">
        <p>Story-wise, according to Complete Arcane, a warlock comes about when a powerful extraplanar entity, usually a
            chaotic and/or evil one, decides to bestow arcane might upon a mortal, giving them all sorts of dark and
            edgy powers. Later material backed off of the “dark and edgy” aspect somewhat, but warlocks are still
            required to be Chaotic or Evil, although you do not lose any class features if your alignment changes.</p>
        <p>The warlock class uses a form of innate magic known as invocations. Unlike other arcane spellcasters,
            warlocks don't have spell slots. Instead, all of their invocations are usable at will. Once you learn one,
            you can use it as much as you want without limit. The signature invocation of the warlock is eldritch blast,
            which allows you to deal a modest amount of untyped damage with a successful ranged touch attack. Other
            invocations are divided into least, lesser, greater, and dark invocations. You unlock a new category every 5
            levels after 1st, and over the course of 20 levels, you end up getting 3 invocations from each category,
            plus detect magic and eldritch blast. Some invocations modify your eldritch blast, altering its properties
            to add additional bonuses and the like.</p>
        <p>Warlocks also have a natural knack for using magic items, gaining the ability to always take 10 on Use Magic
            Device checks at level 4 and the ability to bypass spell requirements for crafting magic items at level 12.
        </p>
        <p>Last and definitely least, warlocks have supernatural resilience, and gain small amounts of damage reduction,
            limited fast healing, and energy resistance, which helps a little bit to make up for the squishy d6 hit die
            they're stuck with, but not that much.</p>
        <p>Warlock base stats are like a slightly beefier sorcerer. You get a d6 hit die, medium base attack bonus, good
            Will saves, and 2 + Int skill points per level. It's a pretty weak chassis. In particular, warlocks tend to
            be skill-starved, but we'll get to that later.</p>
        <p>Less experienced players and DMs sometimes balk at the warlock's at-will abilities and overestimate the
            class's power. This is an overreaction. Yes, they have an at-will attack, but so does any schmoe with a
            weapon, and the warlock's doesn't deal a ton of damage. Yes, they have powerful utility abilities, but
            invocations are scarce and tend to be less individually powerful than the spells that traditional
            spellcasters unlock at the same level. On the whole, the class is actually pretty well-balanced against the
            rest of the game, and could even stand to be buffed a little bit. (For one thing, I'd definitely put them at
            4 skill points and a d8 hit die, like dragonfire adepts.) In the most recent iteration of the tier system,
            the warlock landed into Tier 3, alongside classes like bard, duskblade, healer, swordsage, warmage, and
            wilder.</p>

    <div class="introduction">

        <div class="titlebox">
            <h3 class="titles">Playing a Warlock</h3>
        </div>

        <div class="wwar">

            <p>The warlock play pattern has three pillars. The first is eldritch blast. This is the most visible and
                iconic
                feature of the warlock. You shoot lasers. Eldritch blast is a touch attack, so most enemies will have
                difficulty defending against it, and the damage is untyped, so energy resistance doesn't apply. Spell
                resistance can be an issue, but otherwise, you should have a pretty good hit rate. Your invocation
                options
                also include blast shape and eldritch essence invocations, which can modify your blasts, letting you
                attach
                rider effects or hit multiple targets or the like.</p>
            <p>Bear in mind that eldritch blast does not naturally do a whole lot of damage (unless you sink a lot of
                resources into improving it). You're not a striker. What it does do is give you a consistent source of
                damage, turn after turn, so that you'll almost always be able to contribute in combat at least a little.
                For
                the most part, the addition of blast shapes and eldritch essences won't improve your damage all that
                much—at
                least not to striker levels—but with some investment, it can turn you into a reasonably potent support
                blaster, tagging multiple enemies at a time with debuffs while also taking bites out of their hit
                points.
            </p>
            <p>(Side note: while eldritch blast is often thought of as a laser beam, it doesn't have to be. I've seen
                exploding flowers, eye beams, sword beams, rocket launchers, charged playing cards, Megaman-style arm
                cannons, cartoon hearts delivered by blowing a kiss, and least one walking Monty Python reference who
                summoned eldritch killer rabbits to run over and very briefly savage his enemies. Don't be afraid to
                give it
                your own flair. Warlock Concepts has some ideas to help inspire you.)</p>
            <p>The second pillar is invocations. You don't get very many of them, but the ones you do get should have a
                high
                impact. You can fly, teleport, turn invisible, mind-control people, command undead armies, or whatever,
                and
                you can do it all day long, without any concern for conserving magical resources. This tends to make
                warlocks very good at solving whatever specific problem they specced for. For example, if you choose
                voracious dispelling as one of your invocations, you're gonna be really, really good at making unwanted
                spell effects go away. If you choose flee the scene, you can teleport your way past walls and obstacles
                with
                utter impunity. If you choose call of the beast, then you can talk with the animals, walk with the
                animals,
                and even grunt and squeak and squawk with the animals. However, because of your limited number of
                choices,
                you often end up having a very small toolbox with just a few really high-quality tools.</p>
            <p>Invocations compete for space with eldritch blast upgrades. If you take a bunch of blast shapes and
                eldritch
                essences, you have less room for the powerful utility effects, and vice versa. Try and find a balance as
                best you can according to the needs of your party.</p>
            <p>This brings us to the third pillar: Use Magic Device. Thanks to their 4th level ability, warlocks are
                exceptionally good at making use of wands, scrolls, and other magic items that would normally be
                restricted
                by class. It's important not to overlook this aspect of the class, because it goes a long way towards
                patching up your biggest weakness: inflexibility. Remember how I said you have a small toolbox? UMD
                allows
                you to make it a lot bigger. By stocking up on wands and scrolls of useful spells, you can vastly expand
                your options and make yourself a greater asset to your party. The level 12 crafting ability falls under
                this
                pillar as well, although because it comes online so late and is limited by feat selection, it's not
                quite as
                core to the class.</p>
            <p>Oh, and you get some skills too, although not very many. Most warlocks should prioritize Concentration,
                Spellcraft, and Use Magic Device, but if you can find room, you might also have some social skills with
                Bluff, Intimidate, and/or Sense Motive, or some scholarly aptitude with Knowledge (arcana, planes,
                and/or
                religion).</p>
            <p>As a whole, warlock is a relatively simple class to play. You can always pew-pew with lasers, and you
                have
                some other powers that tend to be fairly straightforward. It's hard to screw up too badly, because
                there's a
                natural baseline level of competency inherent in the progression. (Even if all you're doing is hitting a
                single target with touch attacks for a few d6 of damage a turn, you're definitely underperforming, but
                at
                least you're not totally useless). The trickiest bit is that third pillar. Magic items can really
                elevate
                your game if you use them effectively, but managing your wealth can require some finesse.</p>

            <h3 class="titles">Melee Warlocks</h3>
        </div>

        <div class="wwar">
            <p>Warlocks can also function as melee brawlers via one of several methods. The hideous blow invocation
                allows you to add your eldritch blast damage to a melee weapon attack. The eldritch glaive invocation
                from Dragon Magic allows you to make a full attack in melee with your eldritch blast as if it were a
                reach weapon. The Eldritch Claws feat from Dragon Magazine #358 allows you to use a free action to
                change your eldritch blast into a pair of claws, which can be used as primary natural attacks and deal
                damage equal to your eldritch blast damage plus your unarmed strike damage. And finally, the somewhat
                dubious Grappling Blast feat, also from Dragon #358, allows you to discharge an eldritch blast along
                with each successful grapple check you make to deal damage.

            </p>
            <p>If you invest in melee combat, you can achieve substantially higher single-target damage than your ranged
                counterparts, either by adding Strength and weapon bonuses with hideous blow, making multiple attacks
                with eldritch glaive, or a little of both with Eldritch Claws. I'll cover some of these styles in bits
                and pieces elsewhere in the guide. Shinken's Guide to Melee Warlocks offers a more focused look into the
                topic.

        </div>

        <div class="titlebox">
            <h3 class="titles">Ability Scores</h3>
        </div>

        <div class="wwar">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Strength</strong> allows you to use hideous blow or Eldritch Claws to smash faces in close
                    combat. These builds can output more single-target damage than a traditional ranged warlock, but
                    require more investment, and will put more pressure on your ability scores and feat slots. (Eldritch
                    glaive also uses Strength, but only for the attack roll, not the damage, so you don't need it as
                    much.) Make Strength your highest stat if you want to get up close and personal and don't mind
                    building around that strategy.</li>

                <li><strong>Dexterity</strong> supports a blasting-based strategy. It improves your accuracy as well as
                    your AC, initiative, and Reflex saves, making it useful for both offense and defense. Builds that
                    center on eldritch blast as a ranged attack will usually have Dexterity as their highest or
                    second-highest stat. All builds, of course, will still want as much Dexterity as they can afford.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Charisma</strong> is used for save DCs. Unlike traditional spellcasters, warlocks don't get
                    bonus spells for a high ability score, nor do they need a minimum score in their key ability in
                    order to cast spells, which means you don't necessarily need Charisma. If you aren't investing in
                    social skills and none of your invocations require a saving throw, you can basically dump Charisma
                    entirely (although it does still affect your Use Magic Device bonus). That said, there are quite a
                    few powerful invocations that do allow a save. Without Charisma, it'll be that much more difficult
                    to get any debuff effects to land. Accordingly, if you want to disrupt and debuff your enemies,
                    Charisma should be either your highest or second-highest stat.</li>

                <li><strong>Intelligence</strong> provides you with additional skill points. This is important because
                    warlocks really need those skill points. Concentration, Spellcraft, and Use Magic Device are
                    baseline competencies for a warlock, and that's already more than your 2 per level. If you want to
                    have access to knowledges and social skills and prestige classes without nerfing your
                    skill-dependent class features, you're going to need a good Intelligence score. Making Intelligence
                    your highest stat will give you greater versatility, enabling you to solve a wider range of problems
                    for your party. Even if it's not your highest stat, higher is always better, because I guarantee you
                    will never not want more skill points.</li>

                <li><strong>Constitution</strong> is never going to be a primary stat, but it is always going to be
                    important, because out of all the ability scores, it's the only one that will straight up kill your
                    character if you skimp too much on it. You don't want to get one-shotted by a lucky crit or a failed
                    Reflex save. I usually make Constitution my second or third highest stat, and in point buy, I try to
                    buy it up to 14 if possible.</li>

                <li><strong>Wisdom</strong> is a dump stat. You have a pact with an eldritch being from beyond the veil
                    of reality. Sanity schmanity.
                </li>

            <h3 class="titles">Skills</h3>
        </div>

        <div class="wwar">
            <h4>Class Skills</h4>

            <ul>
                <li><strong class="blue">Bluff (Cha):</strong>A high Bluff skill can make you an all-star in social
                    encounters. It turns out a lot of problems can be solved by lying, provided people believe you. Who
                    knew? It's fairly easy to outpace the Sense Motive checks of NPCs who don't invest in it, and while
                    it's not ideal in the long-term (they'll figure out they were duped eventually), it can bypass a lot
                    of encounters while creating hilarious stories. There are also some relatively cheap ways to get
                    very large bonuses to Bluff, like the glibness spell (+30), the conceal thoughts psionic power
                    (+10), and the Spawn of the Dark Prince feat (+10).</li>

                <li><strong class="blue">Concentration (Con):</strong>This is one of the most important skills for any
                    caster. Concentration allows you to cast defensively to avoid attacks of opportunity if you get
                    caught in melee, and it prevents you from losing your spell if you're distracted or damaged during
                    the casting. There will be a lot of fights where you never need to roll a single Concentration check
                    and it doesn't come up at all, but there will also be fights where you will waste your whole turn
                    and be completely useless if you can't hit a DC 20. You can risk it if you're feeling lucky, but the
                    bad scenario happens often enough and is so devastating that you really want to invest ranks here—at
                    least enough to be able to reliably cast your invocations defensively. It doesn't necessarily need
                    to be maxed, and items like the tunic of steady spellcasting can help, but if you dump this skill,
                    you do so at your own risk. Don't say I didn't warn you.</li>

                <li><strong class="red">Craft (Int):</strong>Just buy the stuff, or hire an expert to craft it for you.
                </li>

                <li><strong class="red">Disguise (Cha):</strong>If you need to disguise yourself, it's usually more
                    efficient to rely on magic like disguise self. You shouldn't be putting points into the skill itself
                    unless you need it for a prerequisite e.g. for chameleon. Not that it doesn't have its uses
                    occasionally, but it's clearly worse than Bluff and you're not made of skill points.</li>

                <li><strong class="pink">Intimidate (Cha):</strong>Using demoralization to stack up levels of fear on
                    enemies is a real strategy, but it requires you to be in melee, so most warlocks won't be able to
                    use it effectively. The main combo is with frightful blast: hit them with the fear effect from your
                    blast, then follow up with a demoralize (hopefully as a move action with fearsome armor or the
                    Steely Gaze feat) to escalate them from shaken to frightened, forcing them to flee. The other use is
                    with the Imperious Command feat, which causes them to cower for a round when you successfully
                    demoralize them. As a social skill, though, I usually find Intimidate to be generally worse than
                    Bluff, and you probably won't have enough resources to take both.</li>

                <li><strong class="Jump">Jump (Str):</strong>You could jump...or you could just fly or teleport instead.
                    If you have a charger in your party, you can take 1 rank to help qualify your team for the Crowded
                    Charge teamwork benefit (Player's Handbook II), but that's about the extent of the skill's
                    usefulness IMO.</li>

                <li><em><strong class="blue">Knowledge (arcana)(Int):</strong></em>This is the Knowledge skill that deals with
                    constructs, dragons, and magical beasts, as well as general arcane magic stuff that isn't already
                    handled under Spellcraft. Magical beasts are reasonably common, and their abilities vary widely from
                    beast to beast, so being able to identify them on sight is very valuable. Constructs are often a
                    warlock's bane, and knowing which ones are going to be immune to your abilities can save you from
                    wasting your actions. Dragons aren't as important to know about, since most of them fall under the
                    umbrella of “Big flying reptile with natural attacks and a breath weapon,” but it can still be handy
                    to know which element goes with which dragon. All told, Arcana is probably the most useful of all
                    the Knowledge skills. I always try to fit in at least 5 points to get the synergy bonus to
                    Spellcraft.</li>

                <li><em><strong class="blue">Knowledge (the planes)(Int):</strong></em>This is the Knowledge skill that covers
                    outsiders and elementals, as well as the overall nature of the cosmos. Outsiders, like magical
                    beasts, vary widely in ability and appearance, so it's useful to know what they can do, although
                    they're not usually as common in most campaigns (at least not until high levels). Elementals, you
                    want to know the basic traits, but you can probably deduce most of the important stuff just by
                    looking at them (“Fire hot. Water wet.” Etc.). Normally I'd value this skill lower than Arcana, but
                    you need 12 ranks of it for hellfire warlock, one of the strongest warlock prestige classes, so it
                    ends up showing up in more builds than it otherwise might.</li>

                <li><em><strong class="blue">Knowledge (religion)(Int):</strong></em>The only creature type covered here is
                    undead, but undead are some of the most common evil minions around, so you'll see a lot of them in
                    most campaigns, especially if you're doing a lot of dungeon crawls. Module writers love them because
                    they represent unambiguously evil punching bags for the PCs to fight, and as a result, you can't
                    walk through a sewer or a crypt or an ancient ruin without tripping over a dozen zombies, skeletons,
                    or ghouls. Now, a little bit of Knowledge (religion) goes a long way, because half the battle is
                    knowing the basic undead traits—but with more ranks, you'll also know things like whether this form
                    of undeath is contagious (and if so, how to prevent its spread), whether this creature requires
                    extra steps to lay it to rest permanently (and if so, what they are), and so on.</li>

                <li><em><strong class="red">Profession (Wis):</strong></em>Great for establishing backstory stuff, but it also
                    doesn't really do anything, so it's pretty underpowered.</li>

                <li><strong class="black">Sense Motive (Wis):</strong>I like being able to read people. It's a solid
                    social skill. It's also not a very proactive one. If the other good skills are already covered by
                    the rest of the party, I might invest in Sense Motive, but it's hard to find space, and when skill
                    points are tight, the “Nice to have” skills will always lose out to the “Must have” skills. If you
                    happen to have Diplomacy, though, Sense Motive can provide a synergy bonus.</li>

                <li><em><strong class="blue">Spellcraft (Int):</strong></em>This is the skill used for identifying magical
                    effects. Since you have detect magic at will, you can bet you'll be identifying a lot of magical
                    effects, and the DCs can climb up pretty high, which means Spellcraft is at a premium. Also, this
                    game just has a lot of spells in it, and even without detect magic, being able to know all the
                    details of your enemie's spells just by paying attention to components as they cast it is a major
                    advantage that will serve you well over the course of your career. Furthermore, you need to make a
                    Spellcraft check to identify scrolls before you can use them, so it's an important complement to Use
                    Magic Device. Oh, and it serves as the prerequisite to several nifty teamwork benefits. I think
                    Spellcraft is one of the most important skills for a warlock, and I pretty much always try to keep
                    it maxed.</li>

                <li><em><strong class="blue">Use Magic Device (Cha):</strong></em>A core warlock skill. You need Use Magic Device
                    in order to use some of your class features. Deceive item lets you take 10 on UMD, and imbue item
                    lets you make a UMD check to bypass spell requirements when crafting magic items. Often, you'll be
                    looking to hit a specific DC here, with DC 20 for wands being the most common benchmark. But the DCs
                    keep climbing up there—standard scroll DCs range from 21–37, for example—so you get more mileage by
                    having a higher modifier. And if you have a familiar (which I recommend, since familiars are great),
                    they share your ranks, but not your ability to take 10, so you'll want as many ranks as possible for
                    their sake. In short, more is better, but you should at least have a high enough bonus to hit a DC
                    20 when you take 10.</li>

            </ul>

            <h4>Cross-Class Skills</h4>

            <ul>
                <li><em><strong class="red">Appraise (Int):</strong></em>I personally think Appraise is a little underrated, and I like to have the single rank to count as trained. But realistically, the benefit is marginal enough and the DCs low enough that there's not much reason to invest any ranks beyond that. Maybe get a wand of appraising touch instead.</li>

                <li><em><strong class="blue">Autohypnosis (Wis):</strong></em>This skill (from Expanded Psionics Handbook) gives you perfect recall of a full page's worth of text or symbols with a DC 15 check. That's not hard to hit (especially since 5 ranks in Concentration gives you a +2 synergy bonus), and memorizing stuff can come in handy. Autohypnosis checks can also help you stabilize more easily when you're dying and retry saving throws against fear effects, both of which are valuable. A little investment here can go a long way, especially if you have the Able Learner feat.</li>

                <li><strong class="red">Balance (Dex):</strong>Mostly useless. 5 ranks prevents you from being flat-footed while balancing, and 10 ranks allows you to use a Balance check to oppose a trip attempt (as per Rules Compendium page 145), but it's cross-class, usable untrained, and becomes obsolete as soon as you gain the ability to fly, so, bleh.</li>

                <li><strong class="red">Climb (Str):</strong>Like Balance, it quickly becomes obsolete once you can fly, but it's actually even worse than that, because it also becomes obsolete once you can spider climb. And even if you can't do either, the best climber in the party can usually go first and drop down a rope ladder to make it easy for everyone else.👎</li>

                <li><em><strong class="red">Decipher Script (Int):</strong></em>This is the sort of skill that you might use once or twice in an entire campaign. It's rarely ever called for, and is mostly useful for the +2 synergy bonus it adds to Use Magic Device checks involving scrolls, if that.</li>

                <li><strong class="blue">Diplomacy (Cha):</strong>I'd call this an even more powerful social skill than Bluff. It's exceptionally valuable for interacting with NPCs, and if you optimize for it, you can even use it mid-combat to pacify your enemies. Sadly, its cross-class nature makes it difficult to work with for most builds, but if you have the Able Learner feat or some way to make it a class skill, you can make it work.</li>

                <li><em><strong class="red">Disable Device (Int):</strong></em>Even if you somehow had trapfinding, it would still be better to use magical means to bypass traps in most cases.</li>

                <li><strong class="red">Escape Artist (Dex):</strong>Most warlocks dump Strength, which can make it difficult to avoid and escape grapples. Escape Artist can help—but if you don't keep it maxed, then it will get outpaced by your BAB anyway. You should have a plan in place for if you get grappled, but for my part I prefer for that plan to be something like a ring of free movement or anklet of translocation.</li>

                <li><em><strong class="red">Forgery (Int):</strong></em>I still can't believe there's a whole skill for this. It's bad, of course. If you need a forgery made, pay a hireling to do it. You'd have to be in a really specific campaign for this to be any good.</li>

                <li><strong class="red">Gather Information (Cha):</strong>Sometimes this skill can help you uncover extra clues in an investigation, but the DCs are rarely high enough to reward any substantial investment, especially since you can use it untrained.</li>

                <li><em><strong class="red">Handle Animal (Cha):</strong></em>Okay, so here's the thing about Handle Animal. It's actually a pretty solid skill. You can get some pet dogs or a bird or whatever and train them into capable minions. Maybe you even find an abandoned wolf cub during your adventures and you rear it as a party mascot. But as a warlock, if that's something you're interested in, you can usually just take call of the beast as an invocation and make the whole skill pretty much irrelevant.</li>

                <li><strong class="red">Heal (Wis):</strong>This skill is used for stabilizing dying characters and that's basically it. Occasionally you'll diagnose a disease or learn the cause of death for a corpse. It can be used untrained and the DCs are low, so there's not much reason to take ranks in it unless you're trying to prestige into nosomatic chirurgeon.</li>

                <li><strong class="pink">Hide (Dex):</strong>If this were a class skill, it would be very strong in combination with the Blend into Shadows feat, which allows you to make a Hide check as a swift action to hide in plain sight. As is, it's actually surprisingly tricky to get it as a class skill without multiclassing (especially if you don't have access to Dragon Magazine for the Flexible Mind feat), which means only dedicated stealth builds will get any use from it. If you can make it work, though, the payoff is there.</li>

                <li><em><strong class="red">Knowledge (architecture and engineering) (Int):</strong></em>It's not a monster knowledge skill and it's frankly not very useful in general, outside of figuring out which walls in a structure are load-bearing. I'd honestly rather take Profession (architect) or Profession (engineer). At least it's a class skill.</li>

                <li><em><strong class="black">Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int):</strong></em>This skill notably covers aberrations and oozes, both of which are nice to be able to identify, but its cross-class status makes it less appealing than arcana, planes, or religion.</li>

                <li><em><strong class="red">Knowledge (geography) (Int):</strong></em>It's weird to me that this is its own skill instead of being part of Nature. Anyway, it's one of the bad Knowledges, so skip it.</li>

                <li><em><strong class="red">Knowledge (history) (Int):</strong></em>While this one can actually give you useful information, I still don't like it because of how easily a Knowledge-centric build could just take paragnostic apostle levels and get the Lore ability basically free, which does the same thing.</li>

                <li><em><strong class="pink">Knowledge (local) (Int):</strong></em>Outside of the Knowledge Devotion feat, you don't usually have much call for a monster knowledge check relating to humanoids, which is what Knowledge (local) covers. They hardly ever have any special abilities that you care about, with the exception of obscure races like ushemoi. On the other hand, if you do have Knowledge Devotion, then this is one of the most important Knowledges because of how common it is to encounter humanoids.</li>

                <li><em><strong class="black">Knowledge (nature) (Int):</strong></em>Another solid monster knowledge skill, covering animals, plants, vermin, fey, giants, and monstrous humanoids. That's a pretty wide selection. Like dungeoneering, it only really suffers from being cross-class.</li>

                <li><em><strong class="pink">Knowledge (nobility and royalty) (Int):</strong></em>The skill itself is pretty weak, but if you have 5 ranks, you get a +2 synergy bonus to Diplomacy.</li>

                <li><strong class="black">Listen (Wis):</strong>Perception skills are valuable, but for the most part it's not your job to be good at them. Make someone else do it. If nobody else wants to do it, then get a familiar to do it, or pick up serpent's tongue as a least invocation and call it good.</li>

                <li><strong class="pink">Move Silently (Dex):</strong>In a sense, it's better than Hide, because you can already get a zillion Hide by being invisible and/or small. In another sense, it's worse than Hide because the main draw to Hide is the Blend into Shadows feat, which doesn't reward you for Move Silently at all—which means it's conceivable that even some stealthy builds don't really need the skill.</li>

                <li><em><strong class="black">Open Lock (Dex):</strong></em>The skill itself is of limited use, especially if you take flee the scene to (essentially) ignore doors or pick up a couple scrolls or a wand of knock. However, taking a single rank is nice because just being able to count as trained is often good enough to unlock a door by taking 20, especially if you have a high Dex and some generic skill boosts.</li>

                <li><em><strong class="red">Perform (Cha):</strong></em>Useless except for prerequisites.</li>

                <li><strong class="red">Ride (Dex):</strong>Mounted combat is usually not the warlock's forte, but it has its advantages. Those advantages generally don't require a ton of ranks in Ride, given how relatively rare it is to actually need better than a DC 5. As nice as it is to mount or dismount as a free action with a DC 20 check, I don't think it's worth investing in a cross-class skill.</li>

                <li><strong class="red">Search (Int):</strong>Warlocks traditionally find traps with detect magic rather than with skill checks, so Spellcraft takes the place of Search. Likewise for many hidden items. Secret doors and clues and such, maybe not, but hopefully you can leave this particular job to the classes that have it as a class skill, or get detect secret doors via magic items. Or just don't worry about it. Either way, not worth investing in, outside of the rare multiclass rogue build.</li>

                <li><em><strong class="red">Sleight of Hand (Dex):</strong></em>This is a cool skill, but I think you need to invest a lot into it in order to use it reliably, and that isn't practical cross-class. Even if you get it as a class skill somehow, there will likely be better places to put your points. It's not a bad skill per se, but it's niche enough that it shouldn't be valued too highly.</li>

                <li><em><strong class="pink">Speak Language:</strong></em>Extra languages are very valuable if you're investing into Bluff or Diplomacy or just taking the charm invocation (which is language-dependent). Ideally, you want to handle the language barrier with magic, either telepathy or tongues. But if you prefer the old-fashioned way, there's nothing wrong with dropping some points into Speak Language.</li>

                <li><strong class="black">Spot (Wis):</strong>See Listen.</li>

                <li><strong class="red">Survival (Wis):</strong>Tracking is niche, navigating in the wilderness rarely matters, foraging for food is easy enough to do untrained, and intuiting directions and predicting the weather are cute but not important in the context of most adventures. It's not a useless skill, but there isn't much reason for you to care about it.</li>

                <li><strong class="red">Swim (Str):</strong>While I appreciate the importance of not drowning, since it is definitely not the way a person who fights monsters for a living is supposed to die, spending cross-class skill ranks on Swim is not a good solution. Use items instead. An armor keel and some masterwork flippers will get you a +4 bonus pretty cheaply, which should be enough for a lightly armored character to avoid a watery grave. At higher levels, you can get a magic item that gives you a swim speed.</li>

                <li><em><strong class="black">Tumble (Dex):</strong></em>I really like the mobility offered by Tumble. Combat in this game tends to be “sticky”—if you're in melee, getting out again can be difficult and painful. Tumble allows you to move around the battlefield without worrying about attacks of opportunity. That's the sort of thing that's especially convenient if you're relying on ranged attacks as your primary combat strategy. 5-foot steps are a thing, of course, which means you don't need Tumble, but that doesn't mean it isn't nice to have for the times when you need to move more than 5 feet at a time. Taking it cross-class isn't really a good option, but if you have Able Learner, then sure.</li>

                <li><em><strong class="black">Use Psionic Device (Cha):</strong></em>The psionic counterpart to Use Magic Device. It's fine, but UMD is better, and I'm skeptical of the value in investing in both. I suppose if you have Able Learner, you could do worse, especially if your DM is dropping psionic items as loot.</li>

                <li><strong class="red">Use Rope (Dex):</strong>I'm sure there's three or four people in the history of D&D who have needed this skill at some point.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Skill Tricks</h4>

            <p>Skill tricks were introduced in Complete Scoundrel and expanded on in Dragon Magazine #357. They can be purchased for 2 skill ranks if you meet the prerequisites, and they can be used once per encounter unless otherwise stated. A full list of skill tricks can be found in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VSz3GaCBQeXsTWTSBppmd7J0qUBg19d1KaBGGwMeyZg/edit#gid=0">this spreadsheet</a>. As a general rule of thumb, most skill tricks are worth taking if you qualify for them, but few of them are worth going out of your way to get the prerequisites.</p>

            <h4>Teamwork Benefits</h4>

            <p>Teamwork benefits are kind of like skill tricks, but for the whole party, and with no per-encounter limit. They appear in Dungeon Master's Guide II, Dungeonscape, Forge of War, Heroes of Battle, and Player's Handbook II. They usually have one prerequisite for the “leader” and a smaller prerequisite for other team members. A full list of teamwork benefits can be found in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VSz3GaCBQeXsTWTSBppmd7J0qUBg19d1KaBGGwMeyZg/edit#gid=0">the same spreadsheet</a>. Unlike skill tricks, you're more likely to go out of your way to qualify for a teamwork benefit, just because the team member requirements don't require you to go as far out of your way. Talk with your party members about which teamwork benefits will be most useful for your team.</p>

    <div class="titlebox">
        <h3 class="titles">Alternative Class Features</h3>
    </div>

<div class="wwar">
    <p>There are only two alternative class features for warlocks, both of which replace fiendish resilience.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong class="red">Fiendish Flamewreath (PH2):</strong>Replaces fiendish resilience with a fire shield that damages anyone who attacks you in melee. The damage starts at 1d6 fire damage and increases at higher levels: 2d6 at level 13, and 5d6 at level 18. However, it remains usable only once per day. This is...maybe okay, I guess, assuming you're a melee warlock and you're already planning to be up close and personal. Even in the ideal scenario, though, I'm still not sure I wouldn't rather have the healing if I'm being hit multiple times like that. Like, even if the build already has fast healing from another source, multiple instances of it stack, so...meh. Just buy a crown of flames.</li>

        <li><strong class="red">Venomous Blood (DrU):</strong>Your blood is poisonous. At level 8, you get +5 to saves against poison. At level 13, anyone who bites or swallows you is subject to a poison that deals 1d3 Strength damage, Fortitude DC 10 + half warlock level + Cha negates. At level 18, you can apply a more concentrated version of this poison to your eldritch blast or a held weapon attack 3 times per day; this takes a move action and increases the Strength damage to 1d6. I think this one is perhaps a bit cooler than the other one, but still not good.</li>
    </ul>
